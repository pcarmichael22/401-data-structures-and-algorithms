Code Challenges 401 - Peter Carmichael

# Challenge Summary
Write a function called FizzBuzzTree which takes a tree as an argument.

## Challenge Description
Write a function called FizzBuzzTree which takes a tree as an argument.
Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, determine weather or not the value of each node is divisible by 3, 5 or both, and change the value of each of the nodes:
If the value is divisible by 3, replace the value with “Fizz”
If the value is divisible by 5, replace the value with “Buzz”
If the value is divisible by 3 and 5, replace the value with “FizzBuzz”
Return the tree with its new values.

For explicitly-typed languages: Ensure your node values are of type Object, to hold either strings or integers.

Find the Maximum Value in a Binary Tree

Specifications
Read all of these instructions carefully. Name things exactly as described.
Do all your work in a public repository called data-structures-and-algorithms, with a well-formatted, detailed top-level README.md.
Create a new branch in your repo called find-maximum-binary-tree.
Your top-level readme should contain a “Table of Contents” navigation to all of your challenges and implementations so far. (Don’t forget to update it!)
This assignment should be completed within the challenges subdirectory of the repository.
On your branch, create…
C#: Extend your BinaryTree class according to the feature tasks below
JavaScript: Extend your BinaryTree class according to the feature tasks below
Python: Extend your BinaryTree class according to the feature tasks below
Java: Extend your BinaryTree class according to the feature tasks below
Include any language-specific configuration files required for this challenge to become an individual component, module, library, etc.
NOTE: You can find an example of this configuration for your course in your class lecture repository.
Feature Tasks
Write an instance method called find-maximum-value. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the maximum value stored in the tree. You can assume that the values stored in the Binary Tree will be numeric.
